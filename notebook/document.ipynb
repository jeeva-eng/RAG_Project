The same overall discussion \\napplies; the diﬀerence is only in the sampling distribu- tion of the \\nresponse data that is collected. \\n \\nA. Aim of the Study \\nGiven two learning algorithms and a particular problem as deﬁned \\nbya dataset, we may want to determine which one has less generalization \\nerror. These can be two diﬀerent algorithms, or one can be a proposed \\nimprovement of the other, for example, by using a better feature extrac- \\ntor.In the general case, we may have more than two learning algorithms, \\nand we may want to choose the one with the least error, or order them in \\nterms of error, for a given dataset.In an even more general setting, instead of \\non a single dataset, we may want to compare two or more algorithms on \\ntwo or more datasets. \\n \\nB. Selection of the Response Variable \\nWe need to decide on what we should use as the quality measure. \\nMost frequently, error is used that is the misclassiﬁcation error for \\nclassiﬁca- tion and mean square error for regression. We may also use \\nsome variant;for example, generalizing from 0/1 to an arbitrary loss, we \\nmay use a riskmeasure. In information retrieval, we use measures such as \\nprecision andrecall. In a cost-sensitive setting, not only the output but also \\nsystem parameters, for example, its complexity, are taken into account. \\n \\nC. Choice of Factors and Levels \\nWhat the factors are depend on the aim of the study. If we ﬁx an \\nal- gorithm and want to ﬁnd the best hyperparameters, then those are \\nthe factors. If we are comparing algorithms, the learning algorithm is a \\nfac-tor. If we have diﬀerent datasets, they also become a factor. \\nThe levels of a factor should be carefully chosen so as not to miss a'),\n",

It is \\nalways good to try to normalize factor levels. For example, in optimizing \\nk of k-nearest neighbor, one can try values such as 1, 3, 5, and so on, but \\nin optimizing the spread h of Parzen windows, we should not try absolute \\nvalues such as 1.0, 2.0, and so on, because that depends on the scale of \\nthe input; it is better to ﬁnd some statistic that is an indicator of scale— \\nfor example, the average distance between an instance and its nearest \\nneighbor—and try h as diﬀerent multiples of that statistic. \\n \\nD. Choice of Experimental Design \\nIt is always better to do a factorial design unless we are sure that \\nthe factors do not interact, because mostly they do. Replication \\nnumber de-pends on the dataset size; it can be kept small when the \\ndataset is large;we will discuss this in the next section when we talk \\nabout resampling.However, too few replicates generate few data and \\nthis will make com-paring distributions diﬃcult; in the particular case of \\nparametric tests, the assumptions of Gaussianity may not be tenable. \\nGenerally, given some dataset, we leave some part as the test set and \\nuse the rest for training and validation, probably many times by resam- \\npling. How this division is done is important. In practice, using small \\ndatasets leads to responses with high variance, and the diﬀerences will \\nnot be signiﬁcant and results will not be conclusive. \\nIt is also important to avoid as much as possible toy, synthetic data \\nand use datasets that are collected from real-world under real-life cir- \\ncumstances. Didactic one- or two-dimensional datasets may help provide \\nintuition, but the behavior of the algorithms may be completely diﬀerent \\nin high-dimensional spaces. \\n \\nE. Performing the Experiment \\nBefore running a large factorial experiment with many factors and \\nlevels,it is best if one does a few trial runs for some random settings to \\ncheck that all is as expected. In a large experiment, it is always a good idea \\nto save intermediate results (or seeds of the random number generator), \\nso that a part of the whole experiment can be rerun when desired. All the \\nresults should be reproducable. In running a large experiment with many \\nfactors and factor levels, one should be aware of the possible negative \\neﬀects of software aging. \\nIt is important that an experimenter be unbiased during experimen- \\ntation. In comparing one’s favorite algorithm with a competitor, both \\nshould be investigated equally diligently. In large-scale studies, it may \\neven be envisaged that testers be diﬀerent from developers. \\nOne should avoid the temptation to write one’s own “library” and \\nin- stead, as much as possible, use code from  reliable  sources;  such code \\nwould have been better tested and optimized. \\nAs in any software development study, the advantages of good docu-\\nmentation cannot be underestimated, especially when working in'),\n",

Statistical Analysis of the Data \\nThis corresponds to analyzing data in a way so that whatever \\nconclusion we get is not subjective or due to chance. We cast the \\nquestions thatwe want to answer in a hypothesis testing framework and \\ncheck whether the sample supports the hypothesis. For example, the \\nquestion \"Is A a more accurate algorithm than B?\" becomes the \\nhypothesis \"Can we say that the average error of learners trained by A is \\nsigniﬁcantly lower than the average error of learners trained by B?\" \\nAs always, visual analysis is helpful, and we can use histograms of \\nerrordistributions, whisker-and-box plots, range plots, and so on \\n \\nG. Conclusions and Recommendations \\nOnce all data is collected and analyzed, we can draw objective \\nconclu- sions. One frequently encountered conclusion is the need for \\nfurther experimentation. Most statistical, and hence machine learning or \\ndata mining, studies are iterative. It is for this reason that we never start \\nwith all the experimentation. It is suggested that no more than 25 \\npercent of the available resources should be invested in the ﬁrst \\nexperiment (Mont- gomery 2005). The ﬁrst runs are for investigation \\nonly. That is also why it is a good idea not to start with high expectations, \\nor promises to one’s boss or thesis advisor. \\nWe should always remember that statistical testing never tells us \\nif the hypothesis is correct or false, but how much the sample seems \\nto concur with the hypothesis. There is always a risk that we do not \\nhave aconclusive result or that our conclusions be wrong, especially if \\nthe data is small and noisy. \\nWhen our expectations are not met, it is most helpful to investigate \\nwhythey are not. For example, in checking why our favorite algorithm A \\nhas worked awfully bad on some cases, we can get a splendid idea for \\nsome improved version of A. All improvements are due to the \\ndeﬁciencies of the previous version; ﬁnding a deﬁciency is but a helpful \\nhint that there is an improvement we can make! \\nBut we should not go to the next step of testing the improved version \\nbefore we are sure that we have completely analyzed the current data \\nandlearned all we could learn from it. Ideas are cheap, and useless unless \\ntested, which is costly. \\n \\n5.2 Cross-Validation and Resampling Methods \\n\\uf0b7 For replication purposes, our first need is to get a number of training \\nand validation set pairs from a dataset X (after having left out some \\npart as the test set). \\n\\uf0b7 To get them, if the sample X is large enough, we can randomly divide it \\ninto K parts, then randomly divide each part into two and use one half \\nfor training and the other half for validation.'),\n",

Unfortunately, datasets are never large enough \\nto do this. \\n\\uf0b7 So we should do our best with small datasets. \\n\\uf0b7 This is done cross-validation by repeated use of the same data split \\ndifferently; this is called crossvalidation. \\n\\uf0b7 The catch is that this makes the error percentages dependent as these \\ndifferent sets share data. \\n\\uf0b7 So, given a dataset X, we would like to generate K training/validation \\nset pairs, {Ti, Vi}K i=1, from this dataset. \\n\\uf0b7 We would like to keep the training and validation sets as large as \\npossible so that the error estimates are robust, and at the same time, \\nwe would like to keep the overlap between different sets as small as \\npossible. \\n\\uf0b7 We also need to make sure that classes are represented in the right \\nproportions when subsets of data are held out, not to disturb the class \\nprior probabilities; this is called stratification. \\n\\uf0b7 If a class has 20 percent examples in the whole dataset, in all samples \\ndrawn from the dataset, it should also have approximately 20 percent \\nexamples. \\n5.3K-Fold Cross-Validation \\n\\uf0b7 K-fold In K-fold cross-validation, the dataset X is divided randomly into K \\nequalcross-validation sized parts, Xi, i = 1,...,K. \\n\\uf0b7 To generate each pair, we keep one of the K parts out as the validation set \\nand combine the remaining K − 1 parts to form the training set. \\n\\uf0b7 Doing this K times, each time leaving out another one of the K parts out, we \\nget K pairs: V1 = X1 T1 = X2 𝖴 X3 𝖴···𝖴XK V2 = X2 T2 = X1 𝖴 X3 𝖴···𝖴XK . . . \\nVK = XK TK = X1 𝖴 X2 𝖴···𝖴XK−1 \\n\\uf0b7 There are two problems with this. First, to keep the training set large, we \\nallow validation sets that are small. \\n\\uf0b7 Second, the training sets overlap considerably, namely, any two training sets \\nshare K − 2 parts. K is typically 10 or 30. \\n\\uf0b7 As K increases, the percentage of training instances increases and we get \\nmore robust estimators, but the validation set becomes smaller. \\n\\uf0b7 Furthermore, there is the cost of training the classifier K times, which \\nincreases as K is increased. \\n\\uf0b7 As N increases, K can be smaller; if N is small, K should be large to allow large \\nenough training leave-one-out sets. \\n\\uf0b7 One extreme case of K-fold cross-validation is leave-one-out where given a \\ndataset of N instances, only one instance is left out as the validation set \\n(instance) and training uses the N − 1 instances.'),\n",

Recently, with computation \\ngetting cheaper, it has also become possible to have multiple runs of K-fold \\ncross-validation, for example, 10×10- fold, and use average over averages to \\nget more reliable error estimates \\n5×2 Cross-Validation \\n\\uf0b7 Dietterich (1998) proposed the 5 × 2 cross-validation, which uses training \\nand validation sets of equal size. \\n\\uf0b7 We divide the dataset X randomly into two parts, X(1) 1and X(2) 1, which gives \\nour first pair of training and validation sets, T1 = X(1) 1and V1 = X(2) 1. \\n\\uf0b7 Then we swap the role of the two halves and get the second pair: T2 = X(2) \\n1and V2 = X(1) 1. \\n\\uf0b7 This is the first fold; X(j) idenotes half j of fold i. To get the second fold, we \\nshuffle X randomly and divide this new fold into two, X(1) 2and X(2) 2. \\n\\uf0b7 This can be implemented by drawing these from X randomly without \\nreplacement, namely, X(1) 1𝖴 X(2) 1= X(1) 2𝖴 X(2) 2 = X. \\n\\uf0b7 We then swap these two halves to get another pair. We do this for three \\nmore folds and because from each fold, we get two pairs, doing five folds, we \\nget ten training and validation sets: T1 = X(1) 1V1 = X(2) 1T2 = X(2) 1 V2 = X(1) 1 \\nT3 = X(1) 2 V3 = X(2) 2 T4 = X(2) 2 V4 = X(1) 2  . . .

Different \\nmeasures appropriate in different settings are given in table 19.2. Let us envisage an \\nauthentication application where, for example, users log on to their accounts by \\nvoice. A false positive is wrongly logging on an impostor and a false negative is \\nrefusing a valid user. It is clear that the two type of errors are not equally bad; the \\nformer is much worse. True positive rate, tp-rate, also known as hit rate, measures \\nwhat proportion of valid users we authenticate and false positive rate, fp-rate, also \\nknown as false alarm rate, is the proportion of impostors we wrongly accept. \\nLet us say the system returns P(C ˆ 1|x), the probability of the positive class, and \\nfor the negative class, we have P(C ˆ 2|x) = 1 − P (C ˆ 1|x), and we choose “positive” if \\nP (C ˆ 1|x) > θ. If θ is close to 1, we hardly choose the positive class; that is, we will \\nhave no false positives but also few true positives. As we decrease θ to increase the \\nnumber of true positives, we risk introducing false positives. \\nFor different values of θ, we can get a number of pairs of (tp-rate, fp-rate) \\nvalues and by connecting them we get the receiver operating characteristics \\ncharacteristics (ROC) curve, as shown in figure 19.3a. Note that different values of θ \\ncorrespond to different loss matrices for the two types of error and the ROC curve \\ncan also be seen as the behavior of a classifier \\nFigure 19.3 (a) Typical ROC curve. Each classifier has a threshold that allows us \\nto move over this curve, and we decide on a point, based on the relative importance \\nof hits versus false alarms, namely, true positives and false positives.

Then, it is reasonable \\nto reject the null hypothesis if pˆ is much larger than p0. How large is large enough is \\ngiven by the sampling distribution of pˆ and the significance α. \\nBecause X is the sum of independent random variables from the same distribution, \\nthe central limit theorem states that for large N, X/N is approximately normal with \\nmean p0 and variance p0(1 – p0).

The answers to those questions become \\ninformation that can be used to make decisions that may not be made with the data elements alone. A \\nsoftware system that enables users to define, create, maintain, query, and control access to the database.is \\nknown as a database management system (DBMS). A computer program that interacts with the database \\nby issuing an appropriate request (typically an SQL statement) to the DBMS is known as a database \\napplication program. \\n \\nTraditional File Processing System: File-based systems were an early attempt to computerize the manual \\nfiling system. However, rather than establish a centralized store for the organization’s operational data, a \\ndecentralized approach was taken, where each department stored and controlled its own data. \\n \\nIssues in File Based Systems: \\n● Separation and isolation of data: When data is isolated in separate files, it is more difficult to \\naccess data that should be available. \\n● Duplication of data: Owing to the decentralized approach taken by each department, the file-\\nbased approach encouraged, if not necessitated, the uncontrolled duplication of data. \\n● Difficulty in accessing data In order to retrieve, access and use stored data, need to write a \\nnew program to carry out each new task. \\n● Program–Data dependence: The physical structure and storage of the data files and records \\nare defined in the application code.  \\n● Data Inconsistency: Data is updated in one file and not in other files and thus some data \\nbecomes invalid. \\n● Data Integrity: Allows some invalid data to enter into the system. \\n● Data Security: Everyone who has access to the file can view all the data. \\n● Atomicity of updates Failures of files may leave database in an inconsistent state with partial \\nupdates carried out.  \\n \\nThree Level Architecture (Abstraction): \\n \\nExternal View: The external or view level includes a number of external schemas or user views. Each external \\nschema describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of \\nthe database from that user group.  \\nConceptual View: The conceptual level has a conceptual schema, which describes the structure of the whole \\ndatabase for a community of users. The conceptual schema hides the details of physical storage structures \\nand concentrates on describing entities, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints \\nPhysical View (Internal View): The internal level has an internal schema, which describes the physical \\nstorage structure of the database. The internal schema uses a physical data model and describes the \\ncomplete details of data storage and access paths for the database.'),\n",

Abstraction \\nThe second component of the learning process is known as abstraction. \\nAbstraction is the process of extracting knowledge about stored data.

When the model \\nhas been trained, the data is transformed into an abstract form that summarizes the \\noriginal information. \\n3. Generalization \\nThe third component of the learning process is known as generalisation. The \\nterm generalization describes the process of turning the knowledge about stored \\ndata into a form that can be utilized for future action.
